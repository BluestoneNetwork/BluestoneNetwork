# BluestoneNetwork
The Bluestone Network is a permissioned blockchain protocol focused on the social and financial inclusion of CARICOM member countries, creating a digital common market.

CARICOM is a 28 member organization of caribbean countries. With a GDP of $140B+, 20M people, 90% mobile penetration and with  50%% of the regional demographic is under the age of 40, these countries have the goal of creating a single market economy. 

The Bluestone Network is focused on interoperability between regional governments, merchants and citizens to increase local trade amongst member countries. 

There are five (5) technology stacks that make up the technology infrastructure of the Bluestone Network. 

(1) Digital ID - Using facial recognition AI, citizens are given a unique ID number based on their facial biometrics. Governments can then use this form of ID to e-KYC citizens, while providing a more secure way to verify indiviuals. Banks and merchants can also use this form of ID when verifying transactions by individuals. 

(2) Simplified Payment Addressing - Opening a bank account throughout the Caribbean can be a strenous process, individuals are often required to provide mutiple forms of ID before set up. Through the Bluestone Network, citizens are given a ubiquitos address that governments, merchants, employers along with,  friends & family can use to quickly send received/transfer money.Simple as sending an email.

(3) Interoperability - Interoperability is key in order for the Bluestone Network to achive its' goal. CARICOM governments will be able to datashare with eachother on citizens throughout the region. This will allow governments to strengthen their borders and verify citizens as they migrate. Merchants and citizens within the region would have a seamless process to conduct regional trade. 

(4) Digita Locker - The digital locker allows governments,merchants and citizens to safely store their documents and access them on the go. All documents are secured on the Bluestone blockchain and a citizen can access them through the Bluestone Wallet, anywhere, anytime. 

(5) E-consent - The E-consent layer allows citizens to selectively share their personal data with governments, employers and other enquirers, putting them in control of their data. Users will be able to put a time stamp on their records before sharing it with enquirers. 

(Think about it, How many jobs have you applied to throughout your life time or sign up on a form, that organization still has your personal info. The risk is TOOOOO high to guess which one of those organizations can or, will be compromised. 

Together, these five (5) layers will create a new regional infrastructure that will socially and financially empower governments, merchants and millions of citizens throughout the CARICOM region. 

Users interact with the Bluestone network through a mobile app,B-ID, in order to access the various digital services offered.
